We will see the iconic, must-see places and look at many hidden corners where he did his magic. And magic it was! :) I will show you his work that is not even listed in books. Are you ready for so much of Plečnik? Don't worry. If you get tired we can stop for Plečnik's tea or.... a cup of Plečnik's favourite wine.
